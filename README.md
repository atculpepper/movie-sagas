# Movie Sagas

## Description

This project is a work in progress! I am working on creating a movie database that shows movie data on the DOM. When an individual listing is clicked, the user should be taken to a "/details" view, where more information about the selected movie is displayed. From "/details," the user will have access to an "edit" button where the user can update the Title and Description of the selected movie. Using redux sagas, this information will be communicated to the server and the server will respond with updated database information, which will be rendered to the DOM.
